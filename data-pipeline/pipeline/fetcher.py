PIPELINE LAYER 1 — FETCHER
============================================================
Role: Data Engineer

Responsibility: Talk to Lobsters' public JSON endpoint and return
the RAW response data. This layer does NOT clean, validate, or
reshape anything — it just fetches and hands back what Lobsters gave us.

Why a separate layer for this?
  - If Lobsters changes their API, only this file needs to change.
  - We can test the rest of the pipeline with fake fetched data,
    without needing the internet.

ABOUT THE DATA SOURCE — lobste.rs:
Lobsters (lobste.rs) is a programming-focused link aggregator. It has
simple, public, unauthenticated JSON endpoints — no API key, no login,
no OAuth needed:

    https://lobste.rs/hottest.json   <- "hottest" front page stories
    https://lobste.rs/newest.json    <- newest submitted stories

There is no "top this month" time-window parameter — Lobsters'
"hottest" endpoint is its own ranking algorithm (a mix of score and
recency), and that's what we use here as our "top posts" source.
It's good practice to still send a descriptive User-Agent identifying
your app, even though it isn't strictly required.
